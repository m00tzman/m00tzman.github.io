        <h3>About the developer:</h3>
        <p>
          First and foremost - <strong>Software is expression</strong>. This is an ethos that has stuck with me from a very young age. As an adolecent on the web in the early 2000's I have been exposed to many works, all of which an extension of their creators. As it was a nascent time in the history of the web these works had to work with, and overcome a variety of limitations in unorthodox and inventive ways.  It is my firm belief that the software we create is an extension of ourselves, our clients, our culture - whether if be from a functional or design point of view. 
        </p>
        <p>
          My facisnation lies in human-software interaction, as well as the creation of <strong>tactile</strong> and <strong>accessible</strong> interfaces. Throughout my career, a common thread has been addressing the needs and capablilities of different audiences - whether it be for small local markets, or large education software platforms created for users with a large skill disparty. I want to continue to refeine my skills and create new methods of interaction that engage the end user.

        <h3>About the person:</h3>
        <p>
          I am a lover of music with moody synthesizers, stories about robots, long distance running (preferrably in a place with a view), tiny dogs that look like mops, hyper-referential humor, and trying to integrate cayenne pepper into everything I cook.
        </p>
        <p>I am also an aspiring Tetris Grandmaster, with an emphasis on Tetris: The Grandmaster 1. </p>
        <p>
          I recieved a B.A. in New Media from SUNY Purchase, as well as attended New York Code And Design Academy as a part of their Web Development 100, Ruby On Rails, and Advanced Front End courses.
