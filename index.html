                <h3>The developer:</h3>
                <p>
                    First and foremost - <strong>Software is expression</strong>. This is an ethos that has stuck with me
                    from a very young age. As an adolecent on the web in the early 2000's I have been exposed to many works,
                    all of which an extension of their creators. As it was a nascent time in the history of the web these
                    works had to work with, and overcome a variety of limitations in unorthodox and inventive ways. It is
                    my firm belief that the software we create is an extension of ourselves, our clients, our culture - whether
                    it be from a functional or design point of view.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My facisnation lies in human-software interaction, as well as the creation of <strong>tactile</strong>                    and <strong>accessible</strong> interfaces. Throughout my career, a common thread has been addressing
                    the needs and capablilities of different audiences - whether it be for small local markets, or large
                    education software platforms created for users with a large skill disparty. I want to continue to refine
                    my skills and create new methods of interaction that engage the end user.

                <h3>The person:</h3>
                <p>
                    I am a lover of music with moody synthesizers, stories about robots, long distance running (preferrably in a place with a
                    view), tiny dogs that look like mops, hyper-referential humor, and trying to integrate cayenne pepper
                    into everything I cook.
                </p>
                <p>You can most likely find me at a local arcade looking for a <i>Tetris - The Grand Master</i> cabinet.</p>
                <p>
                    I recieved a B.A. in New Media from SUNY Purchase, as well as attended New York Code And Design Academy as a part of their
                    Web Development 100, Ruby On Rails, and Advanced Front End courses.
